          Our cutting-edge hospital management solution addresses the critical needs of modern healthcare systems. 
          We focus on optimizing queuing models in Outpatient Departments (OPDs), managing bed availability, 
          and streamlining patient admissions, ensuring hospitals operate efficiently and effectively. Our solution 
          can be seamlessly integrated with a city-wide healthcare module, offering a scalable approach to healthcare management.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Key Challenges in Healthcare</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Hospitals face numerous challenges, including long wait times in OPDs, unpredictable bed availability, and inefficient 
          patient admission processes. These challenges often lead to bottlenecks, reduced patient satisfaction, and operational inefficiencies.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Our Solution</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Our hospital management system tackles these challenges head-on by implementing dynamic queuing models, real-time bed 
          availability tracking, and automated patient admission workflows. These tools help reduce patient wait times, 
          optimize bed usage, and ensure smoother hospital operations.
        </p>
